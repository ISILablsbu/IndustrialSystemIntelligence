summary: Hand-on training on swarm robots.
abstract: " LSBU ISI Lab is proud to host the 2025 Kilobot Swarm Intelligence Workshop. This two-day event is designed for undergraduate (BSc) and postgraduate (MSc) students to gain hands-on experience with decentralized, collective artificial intelligence.

Participants will move from foundational principles to advanced applications, exploring how complex, emergent group behaviors can arise from simple, locally-executed rules. The forum will feature a series of technical workshops culminating in a dynamic swarm robotics challenge, providing a unique opportunity to program, test, and deploy algorithms on a large-scale Kilobot collective."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
